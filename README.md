# Parallel Programming Special Project
### Jonathan Hartnett
This project measures the performance benefits gained from parallelizing a quicksort implementation. Tested on Ubuntu. 
Simply running the project with sort a large array of random numbers using 1 to n threads where n is the number of cores detected on the machine.
The results of the test are output to stdout in both textual and graphical format.
